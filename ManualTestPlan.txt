Step 1:
    Write a bunch of console.log() statements. Everywhere.
Step 2:
    Make sure the output makes sense and is what you expected.
Step 3:
    Delete most of console.log() statements so people won't think you're a imbecile
    who only knows how to debug using print statements.


If you do these steps correctly and rigorously check at every conceivable var assignment
or return, you should be able to continue writing without worrying about functions already written.
